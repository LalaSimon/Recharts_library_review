# Recharts - React chart library

# Description

Easy and enjoyable for simple charts, but when we need something more complex and sophisticated, I would give up. One chart doesn't work at all, or maybe I'm too dumb for it - the Sankey Chart. The documentation didn't help, and even stackoverflow and GPT gave up.

Additionally, not everything can be customized, so for more fancy things that one might want to implement here, recharts won't be able to handle it.
